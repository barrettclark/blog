Go 1.4 is out!  I won't reiterate the changes, read the [release notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.4) for that.
But it's one thing to read that things have improved -- **what if I could show you the improvement?**

These snapshots are from an upcoming feature for [Inspeqtor Pro](http://contribsys.com/inspeqtor): real-time
memory and GC monitoring for any Go-based daemon.  They show the first 3 minutes of Inspeqtor Pro itself
starting up.  After 1 minute, it sends an alert email.  That big spike you see is all the code required to
send email to Gmail (`net/smtp`, TLS, etc) being paged into memory.  The small but regular bumps in Allocated
Memory are from Inspeqtor Pro gathering system metrics every 15 seconds.

Some notes: GC in 1.4 looks faster than in 1.3.3, there's no pause in 1.3.3 that is less than 1ms.
Total memory shrunk about 1MB, from 4 to 3 MB, and the total size at startup is noticably smaller.  Awesome!

Interested in seeing this for your own Go daemons?  Chime in on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor/issues/65)
and give [Inspeqtor](https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor/wiki#getting-started) a test drive.
