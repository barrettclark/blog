Let's review some numbers, from the 1st birthday:

*   214,300 downloads
*   2144 stars
*   662 closed issues
*   266 forks
*   228 closed pull requests
*   44 versions released
*   25 Sidekiq Pro customers

Now, on the 2nd birthday:

*   **1,192,259** downloads (wow, huge uptake!)
*   3535 stars
*   1420 closed issues
*   563 forks
*   380 closed pull requests
*   74 versions released
*   Over 200 Sidekiq Pro customers

At this point I believe I've achieved my goals: build the best background job framework, bar none. With Sidekiq I try to have it all: good performance, easy setup, deep integration with an application framework like Rails and a rich set of functionality. I hope you think I was successful in my efforts.

As always, thank you to my users and keep 'kiqing!
