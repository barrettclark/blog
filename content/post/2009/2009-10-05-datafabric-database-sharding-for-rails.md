title: DataFabric -- database sharding for Rails

With the closing of FiveRuns, the blog post that was the main page for [DataFabric][1] has disappeared. I'm creating this blog post as a replacement.

DataFabric is a Rails plugin/gem that adds sharding support to ActiveRecord. It supports Rails 2.x and is theoretically database independent, although I haven't tested it personally with anything but MySQL and SQLite. Please see the [github home page][1] for the latest code, examples and a more in-depth explanation.
