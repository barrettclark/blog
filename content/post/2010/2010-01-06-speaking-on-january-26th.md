I've been enjoying my holiday break (perhaps a bit too much since I've produced no new blog content) but to shake off the cobwebs I've signed up to speak at [Austin on Rails][1] this month on "Scalable Ruby Processing with EventMachine". I'll discuss the advantages of event-driven programming in general, why it's especially useful to the Ruby world and some of the work I've been doing in my spare time on my [Evented][2] project. Hope to see you there!
