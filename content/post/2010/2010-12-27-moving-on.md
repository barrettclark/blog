Good news, everybody &mdash; I'm starting a new job in 2011! I've accepted a position at [Carbon Five][1]. While I enjoyed the challenges of starting a new business, I found the 60+ hr work weeks just unmaintainable with a new baby in the house. Carbon Five presents me many of the same challenges of Bootspring (e.g. finding new clients, recruiting new developers, designing and developing great code for victory) without the tedious bits (e.g. working alone, administrivia, etc). I'm very excited to meet and work with a new set of smart people and solve new problems in the coming year!
