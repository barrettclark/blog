title: Stream Processing and Trending Data

[The Britney Spears Problem][1] is a fantastic article from American Scientist about real-time processing of streaming data to determine trends. I love discovering clever new algorithms and the "majority algorithm" is simple, easy to implement but something you probably wouldn't think up yourself if solving the same problem. If you've ever wondered how Twitter's trending feature is implemented, this is probably a good place to start.
