I did an interesting experiment to compare memcache-client and [Dalli][1] performance this morning. I wanted to understand which library allocated more objects in order to know which library would have more GC overhead. Ruby 1.9 has a new module [GC::Profiler][2] which will generate a report with stats about each GC run. Since both gems have an identical benchmark suite, I ran the GC Profiler on the benchmark suite for each:

<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="10">
  <tr>
    <th>
      &nbsp;
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Runs
    </th>
    
    <th>
      GC Time
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Total Time
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      memcache-client
    </th>
    
    <td>
      596
    </td>
    
    <td>
      3.40
    </td>
    
    <td>
      18.35
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      dalli
    </th>
    
    <td>
      153
    </td>
    
    <td>
      1.73
    </td>
    
    <td>
      15.29
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

memcache-client runs the GC 4x as much as Dalli and roughly half of Dalli's speed improvement over memcache-client is due to more efficient object allocation requiring less garbage collection. Note that Dalli's GC runs seem to take twice as long as the memcache-client runs. Anyone know Ruby 1.9's GC implementation and have an idea why this might be?
