Every year I attend Rubyconf and Railsconf and this year is no
different.  I launched Sidekiq 4.0 at Rubyconf 2015 and now I'm excited
 to get down to Phoenix and launch Sidekiq 5.0!
I want to meet any Rubyists, new or old, who want to chat.

## A Personal Note

I attended my first conference in 2007, Rubyconf, in Charlotte NC.
I still remember my mental state: **awkwardness, isolation and loneliness
because I knew about two people there**.  By nature I'm an introvert and
not really good at mingling in crowds (one reason booze is so popular
at conferences: it can decrease your inhibitions and make you more chatty).
As my reputation increased in the community, going to conferences became
easier because people knew me but here's my dirty secret:
I'm still awkward and not great at socializing with new people.

So I have a guarantee: if you don't know anyone at Railsconf or just
need someone to talk to, find me and say hello.  The first day I always
wear a Sidekiq t-shirt.  You know my blog and here's some
topics I will talk endlessly about:

* You and your Ruby story
* Performance and scalability
* Threading vs Evented design in languages and systems
* Sidekiq and other background job systems
* Ruby, Crystal and Go
* Open Source, Sustainability, and Business
* Soccer, Motorcycles and Sports Cars (ask me about the time I crashed a
  race car at Laguna Seca!)

It's also quite likely that you know my name but I don't know yours and
I'm terrible with names/faces so **please introduce yourself**.

PS And of course, I'm giving away Sidekiq stickers to anyone who asks.
