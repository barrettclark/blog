It seems that the "fast" debugger does not work for me with Netbeans 6.0b2. Switching to the slow debugger made things work as expected. Note that it's really easy to make something fast if you don't need it to function correctly. :-)

UPDATE: Martin from Sun commented with some guidance on how to get more information from Netbeans.Â  I could not reproduce it this morning but if you see this behavior, follow Martin's directions in his comment so they can get the issue fixed!
