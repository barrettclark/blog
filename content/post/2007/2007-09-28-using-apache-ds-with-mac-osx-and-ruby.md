I have a soft spot in my heart for Apache. They are one of the oldest open source organizations, their software is generally high quality and I'm a member. I tried out their LDAP server, [Apache DS][1], on Windows a few months ago and found it quick to install and easy to use. I'm going to do the same with OSX and, over the next few days, document what I did for the benefit of others.
