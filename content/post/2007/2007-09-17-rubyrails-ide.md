Here's a great example of next generation IDEs coming to fruition. When I first started using Rails 2 years ago, I was daunted by the magic occurring behind the scenes and lack of a good IDE which understands and helps me traverse that magic. TextMate and RadRails were the first but CodeGear looks like a strong upstart.
