Some back of the envelope numbers I was pondering this morning:

40 hours / week * 50 weeks / year = 2000 hr / yr

Bill Gates is worth about $66 billion. He's worked for about 33 years now.

66 billion / 33 years = $2 billion/year / 2000 = $1 million / hour.

Bill Gates has made roughly $1 million per hour over the length of his career. Most people would be happy to make that amount in a decade. No moral or judgment here, just an astonishing number to think about.
