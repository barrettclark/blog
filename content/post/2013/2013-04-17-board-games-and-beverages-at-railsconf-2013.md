You are invited to a whimsical evening of merriment and gamesmanship!

What: Board Games and Beverages  
Where: [Skyroom Lounge][1], top of Red Lion Hotel, across the street from Railsconf  
When: Tuesday, 4/30 7-11pm

The Skyroom has a great view of Portland so try to get there before sundown. We should have enough games for everyone but bring your favorite if you'd like. They have food if you need a late dinner. They have room for 250 so I'm hoping we'll have plenty of room for everyone.

If you're in, please comment to RSVP!
