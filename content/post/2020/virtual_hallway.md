I love Rubyconf and Railsconf. I've attended every one in the last 7
years and was super excited to learn that Railsconf would be held in my
home town of Portland this year.

Alas, the virus struck and Railsconf was cancelled. [Railsconf 2020.2
Couch Edition](https://railsconf.com) was announced but my favorite part of conferences is the
**hallway track**: meeting old friends in person, making new friends,
talking about our lives and crazy ideas we have to make Ruby and open
source better.

## The Virtual Hallway Trackâ„¢

I thought: if we can have a virtual conf, why not have a virtual hallway track?
Jump into a video chat with other Rubyists, introduce yourself and tell
us something:

* Which videos have you watched and enjoyed?
* What's your latest or favorite Ruby gem you've discovered?
* What's a programming accomplishment you're proud of?
* How has your life changed with the virus?

I've created a few video chat rooms, each room has a **12 person limit**.
**[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/getajobmike)** if you want to get reminders and updates during the day.

**Tues, May 5th all day, drop in and drop out whenever, hallways are random!**

[Honeybadger](https://honeybadger.io) is running another virtual hallway here:

If the first room is full, jump into the next one! I will try to be in a
room at the top of each hour during my work day (9am-4pm Pacific).

## Etiquette

Here's some tips to make the rooms as useful as possible:

* If you want to lurk, that's OK, just turn off your camera and mute your mic so you don't distract others.
* If a room is getting full, please drop out or jump into another one unless you are actively participating.
* Use AirPods or a headset microphone if possible. Mute your microphone when you are not speaking.

Good luck and have fun!
