I'm going to be speaking at a few groups/conferences over the next two months:

*   San Franscisco Ruby Meetup, Oct 16th
*   Austin on Rails, Austin TX, Oct 28th
*   RubyConf 2008, Orlando FL, Nov 6-8th
*   Raleigh.rb, Raleigh NC, Nov 18th

I'll be giving my new "Patterns in Distributed Computing" talk, discussing some of the hard problems in the distributed computing space and my own attempts over the last year to solve some of them.
