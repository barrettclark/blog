title: Google Reader ignores language settings?

I'm in the Czech Republic right now, touring Prague.  Now when I visit Google Reader, the UI is rendered in (presumably) Czech.  I checked my browser and it is set to show EN-US and then EN.  Then I checked my Reader settings and set the desired language to English.  Yet Google Reader still does not render in English.  Presumably Google is using geocoding to get the country of origin for this IP address and using it as a guess for the language to use.  Why it doesn't use either of the previous settings, I can't fathom.
