Good News Everybody!  I'll be speaking at RubyConf 2008 in Orlando, FL in November on "Patterns in Distributed Computing".  I'm going to discuss the various algorithms we've used to provide fault tolerance, reliablility and performance from server-side processing daemons.

In other news, this week marks my first anniversery in the professional Ruby world.  I'm pretty happy with what I've achieved so far and I hope the next year is just as fun and challenging.
