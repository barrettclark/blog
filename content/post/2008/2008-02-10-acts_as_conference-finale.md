I'm finishing up here at [acts\_as\_conference][1] in Orlando, FL.  I got to hang out with some of the Rubinius and Merb people.  [Yehuda][2], Merb wizard extraordinaire, gave me a tip on how to ease my pain with ActionMailer (apparently Merb now has a mailer too) so I'll be checking that out to see if we can't make the notifier portion of the FiveRuns service a little cleaner.

Now I'm off to Austin.  See you on the flip side, loyal reader!
