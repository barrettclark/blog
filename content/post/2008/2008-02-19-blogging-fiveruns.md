We at FiveRuns are trying to make a more concerted effort to blog regularly on the [FiveRuns blog][1].  To that end, I've written [my first post][2] on the various storage options considered for our metric storage subsystem.  I'll probably focus most of my posts over the next few months on my ongoing work to tune and scale our service.  That type of content is what interests me and I hope you enjoy it too.
