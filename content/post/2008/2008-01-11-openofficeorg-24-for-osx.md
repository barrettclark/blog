Mac OS X has been somewhat of a red-headed stepchild wrt free office suites since OpenOffice.org declared a few years ago that it did not have the resources to support an OSX version.  OOo did put out an official 2.3 developer build 6 months ago but it is ugly and buggy.  However with the recent resurgence in OSX, OOo has restarted development, the upcoming 2.4 release has official OSX support and the beta binary is already better and more stable than the old 2.3 developer release.  If you are using that build, I'd recommend you check out the latest stable milestone.  It does have one obvious bug (the File Open dialog initially appears as blank, just click Cancel and reopen it) but it seems better in every other way to me so far.
