Here's an interesting talk from Reginald Braithwaite on Ruby code manipulation. I'm wondering if the difficulties he's found in trying to build macro processing in Ruby is intrinstic in Ruby's design. It seems like macros are a fringe feature in Ruby, but a core feature in Lispy languages due to language design. When code is data and data is code, macros become second nature.
