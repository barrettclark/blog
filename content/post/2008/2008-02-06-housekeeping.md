Since I started this blog a few months ago, I've been cringing inside every time I see it and I'll tell you why: I dislike default configurations. Invariably I want to tweak, tune or, if you'll excuse the hip lingo, pimp everything I touch, especially if it involves software. This includes the theme for my blog, which until now was the default WordPress theme. Hasta la vista, Kubrick â€” you've been dumped for Cutline.

I'll need to tweak the Google ads and analytics and spice up things here and there but hopefully you'll feel more at home now, gentle reader.
