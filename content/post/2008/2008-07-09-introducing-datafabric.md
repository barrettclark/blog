I just published a new Ruby Gem which encapsulates the database sharding library we've been using in production with our [FiveRuns Manage][1] service.  I'm pretty proud of this release -- it wasn't easy code to write or test and I learned a LOT about ActiveRecord while writing it.  If you need sharding and you need to use ActiveRecord, give DataFabric a try.
