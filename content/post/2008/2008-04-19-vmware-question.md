I'm trying to test my pet project in IE by using VMWare Fusion with an WinXP virtual machine.  The problem is one of networking.  How do I get the XP guest to see the server on the OSX host?  I've got my site running at http://localhost:3000 but that address obviously doesn't work.  Neither the host's hostname nor IP address works either.  How do I set up the guest networking so the guest can see the host's services?
