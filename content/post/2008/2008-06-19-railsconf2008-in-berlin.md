With all due respect to Pres. Kennedy, I stole his memorable phrase because I'm going to Berlin! [RailsConf Europe 2008][1] accepted my talk "How NOT to Build a Service". I'm very excited to be traveling to Europe; it's been three years since I was in Amsterdam and I can't wait to visit the area again. In summary, here's my speaking schedule for the next three months:

*   OSCON -- Portland, OR July 25-29
*   RailsConf Europe -- Berlin, Germany Sep 2-4
*   LoneStar Ruby Conf -- Austin, TX Sep 4-6

I'll be talking on the last day of LSRC to give myself time to travel back to the US.
