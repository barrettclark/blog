Looks like my talk "How NOT to Build a Service" has been accepted by the LSRC organizers. I really enjoyed the conference last year and it's an honor to be chosen as one of the speakers this year.

The great thing about the LSRC is proximity: it's two miles from my house. If anyone needs a sofa to crash on -- let me know!
