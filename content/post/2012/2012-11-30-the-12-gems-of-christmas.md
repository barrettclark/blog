For the holiday season this year, I thought it would be nice to look around the Rubygems ecosystem and see if I could find some new highlights or old, under-appreciated gems to highlight in a series of blog posts I'm calling **The 12 Gems of Christmas**. There will be no Lords a-leapin' or Partridges in any Pear Trees but there will be lots of useful Ruby code for you to explore.

I'll be posting one gem per day for the next 12 days, starting with #12 tomorrow and counting down to #1. Tomorrow we'll learn about a useful gem for storing trees... in your database! [Follow me on Twitter][1] or subscribe to this blog to get each day's post!
