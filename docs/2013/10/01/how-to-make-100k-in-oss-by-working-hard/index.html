      <h1>How to make $100k in OSS by working hard</h1>
      <small class="post-meta">Oct 1, 2013</small>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>My <a href="http://sidekiq.org">Sidekiq</a> project isn't just about building the best background processing framework for Ruby, it's also a venue for me to experiment with ways to make open source software financially sustainable for the developers who work on it hundreds of hours each year (e.g. me). Let's review.</p>

<p>When Sidekiq was first released in Feb 2012, I offered a commercial license for $50. Don't like Sidekiq's standard LGPL license? Upgrade to a commercial license. In nine months of selling commercial licenses, <strong>I sold 33 for $1,650</strong>. If you figure I spent 300 hours building Sidekiq, that's less than minimum wage. Result: failure.</p>

<p>In October last year I announced a big change: I would sell additional functionality in the form of an add-on Rubygem. <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq Pro</a> would cost $500 per company and add several complex but useful features not in the Sidekiq gem. I do little to market it, don't buy ads or sponsor anything; it's sold purely through word of mouth and mentions in the Sidekiq documentation.</p>

<p>In the last year selling Sidekiq Pro, <strong>I sold about 140 copies for $70,000</strong>. Assuming I've spent 700 hours on Sidekiq so far, that's $100/hr. Success! Sales have actually notched up as Sidekiq has become more popular and pervasive: my current sales rate appears to be about $100,000/yr.</p>

<p>This isn't retirement money but it is very respectable money for a side project and one I could make into a full-time job if desired. It makes supporting Sidekiq something I enjoy rather than a chore I dread: in the last year I've released 34 versions of Sidekiq with lots of new features, bug fixes and tons of contributions from the community.</p>

<p>My one open question is how to market Sidekiq Pro now? Sure, I could fill the Sidekiq website with boring whitepaper case studies and sell 24/7 support but... ugh. So far my best response has been at developer conferences: when I meet and network with other Rubyists to answer their questions and soothe their fears, they buy Sidekiq Pro. I wish I had the time and fortitude to travel around the world but a wife and child does not allow this flexibility.</p>

<p>As always, thank you to my customers for making this ongoing experiment a success and I hope the results so far encourage other OSS developers to experiment with ways to finance their own hard work.</p>
