      <h1>Happy Birthday Sidekiq!</h1>
      <small class="post-meta">Feb 5, 2013</small>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>This day last year I released Sidekiq 0.5.0 to the public. I left Carbon Five in mid-January and was moving to Portland to join <a href="http://www.theclymb.com/invite-from/mperham">The Clymb</a> with wife and child in tow. For the previous few months, I'd been thinking about background processing and felt there was opportunity for a library that was more efficient and also provided more functionality. I spent my two weeks of downtime building what became Sidekiq.</p>

<p>In one year, some numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>214,300 downloads</li>
<li>2,144 watchers</li>
<li>662 closed issues</li>
<li>266 forks</li>
<li>228 closed pull requests</li>
<li>44 versions released</li>
<li>1 <a href="/2013/01/30/2012-oss-rookie-project-of-the-year/">Major Awardâ„¢</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq Pro</a> has been available for four months now and sales have ramped up as Sidekiq gained traction, exactly like I had hoped. January was my biggest sales month so far. Thank you to my Pro customers!</p>

<p>My goal for the first year was to become one of the big three: I wanted people to see Sidekiq as a peer to Resque and Delayed Job. I think that's true now and believe Sidekiq has matched Delayed Job in terms of project velocity. <strong>For the next year, my goal is to overtake Resque and make Sidekiq the #1 background job library for Ruby.</strong> There will always be a place for other libraries for various reasons (e.g. redis not available) but I believe Sidekiq's great performance and wide range of functionality can't be beat by any competing library today.</p>

<p>It's been fantastic working with new contributors, noticing more and more people recommend Sidekiq to their friends and seeing my vision of simple, efficient background processing becoming reality. I promise to continue support for Sidekiq and hope this year goes just as well as the first!</p>
