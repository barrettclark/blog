        <p><img src="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/media/img/cassandra_logo.png" alt="Cassandra logo" /></p>

<p>We've started using Cassandra as our next-generation data storage engine at <a href="http://www.onespot.com">OneSpot</a> (replacing a very large Postgresql machine with a cluster of EC2 machines) and so I've been using it for the last few weeks. As I'm an infrastructure nerd and a big believer in understanding the various layers in the stack, I've been reading up a bit on how Cassandra works and wanted to write a summary for others to benefit from. Since Cassandra is known to have very good write performance, I thought I would cover that first.</p>

<p>First thing to understand is that Cassandra wants to run on many machines. From what I've heard, Twitter uses a cluster of 45 machines. It doesn't make a lot of sense to run Cassandra on a single machine as you are losing the benefits of a system with no single point of failure.</p>

<p>Your client sends a write request to a single, random Cassandra node. This node acts as a proxy and writes the data to the cluster. The cluster of nodes is stored as a &quot;ring&quot; of nodes and writes are replicated to N nodes using a <em>replication placement strategy</em>. With the RackAwareStrategy, Cassandra will determine the &quot;distance&quot; from the current node for reliability and availability purposes where &quot;distance&quot; is broken into three buckets: same rack as current node, same data center as current node, or a different data center. You configure Cassandra to write data to N nodes for redundancy and it will write the first copy to the primary node for that data, the second copy to the next node in the ring <em>in another data center</em>, and the rest of the copies to machines in the same data center as the proxy. This ensures that a single failure does not take down the entire cluster and the cluster will be available even if an entire data center goes offline.</p>

<p>So the write request goes from your client to a single random node, which sends the write to N different nodes according to the replication placement strategy. There are many edge cases here (nodes are down, nodes being added to the cluster, etc) which I won't go into but the node waits for the N successes and then returns success to the client.</p>

<p>Each of those N nodes gets that write request in the form of a &quot;RowMutation&quot; message. The node performs two actions for this message:</p>

<ul>
<li>Append the mutation to the commit log for transactional purposes</li>
<li>Update an in-memory Memtable structure with the change</li>
</ul>

<p>And it's done. This is why Cassandra is so fast for writes: the slowest part is appending to a file. Unlike a database, Cassandra does not update data in-place on disk, nor update indices, so there's no intensive <em>synchronous</em> disk operations to block the write.</p>

<p>There are several asynchronous operations which occur regularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>A &quot;full&quot; Memtable structure is written to a disk-based structure called an SSTable so we don't get too much data in-memory only.</li>
<li>The set of temporary SSTables which exist for a given ColumnFamily are merged into one large SSTable. At this point the temporary SSTables are old and can be garbage collected at some point in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are lots of edge cases and complications beyond what I've talked about so far. I highly recommend reading the Cassandra wiki pages for <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureInternals">ArchitectureInternals</a> and <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations">Operations</a> at the very least. Distributed systems are hard and Cassandra is no different.</p>

<p>Please leave a comment if you have a correction or want to add detail -- I'm not a Cassandra developer so I'm sure there's a mistake or two hidden up there.</p>
