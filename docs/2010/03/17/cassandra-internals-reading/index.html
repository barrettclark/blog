<p>In my <a href="/2010/03/13/cassandra-internals-writing/">previous post</a>, I discussed how writes happen in Cassandra and why they are so fast. Now we'll look at reads and learn why they are slow.</p>

<p><strong>Reading and Consistency</strong></p>

<p>One of the fundamental thereoms in distributed systems is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">Brewer's CAP theorem</a>: distributed systems can have Consistency, Availability and Partition-tolerance properties but can only guarantee two. In the case of Cassandra, they guarantee AP and loosen consistency to what is known as <em>eventual consistency</em>. Consider a write and a read that are very close together in time. Let's say you have a key &quot;A&quot; with a value of &quot;123&quot; in your cluster. Now you update &quot;A&quot; to be &quot;456&quot;. The write is sent to N different nodes, each of which takes some time to write the value. Now you ask for a read of &quot;A&quot;. Some of those nodes might still have &quot;123&quot; for the value while others have &quot;456&quot;. They will all eventually return &quot;456&quot; but it is not guaranteed when (in practice, usually just a few milliseconds). You'll see why this is important in a second.</p>

<p>Reads are similar to writes in that your client makes a read request to a single random node in the Cassandra cluster (aka the Storage Proxy). The proxy determines the nodes in the ring (based on the replica placement strategy) that hold the N copies of the data to be read and makes a read request to each node. Because of the eventual consistency limitations, Cassandra allows the client select the strength of the read consistency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single read -- the proxy returns the first response it gets. Can easily return stale data.</li>
<li>Quorum read -- the proxy <strong>waits for a majority to respond with the same value</strong>. This makes it much more difficult to get stale data (nodes would have to go down) but slower.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the background, the proxy also performs <em>read repair</em> on any inconsistent responses. The proxy will send a write request to any nodes returning older values to ensure that the nodes return the latest value in the future. There are a number of edge cases here that I'm not clear how Cassandra deals with:</p>

<ul>
<li>What if an even number of nodes reply, with half returning a value of &quot;X&quot; and the other half returning a value of &quot;Y&quot;? Since each column value is timestamped, presumably it will use the timestamp as a tie breaker.</li>
<li>What if two nodes return &quot;X&quot; with an old timestamp and one node returns &quot;Y&quot; with a newer timestamp? Does quorum override the clock?</li>
<li>What if the clocks on the cluster nodes are out of sync?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scanning ranges</strong></p>

<p>Cassandra works fine as a key/value store: you give it the key and it will return the value for that key. But this is often not enough to answer critical questions: what if I want to read all users whose last name starts with Z? Or read all orders placed between 2010-02-01 and 2010-03-01? To do this, Cassandra must know how to determine the nodes which hold the corresponding values. This is done with a <em>partitioner</em>. By default, Cassandra uses a <em>RandomPartitioner</em> which is guaranteed to spread the load evenly across your cluster but cannot be used for range scanning. Instead a ColumnFamily can be configured to use an <em>OrderPreservingPartitioner</em>, which knows how to map a range of keys directly onto one or more nodes. In essence, it knows which node(s) hold the data for your alphabetically-challanged users and for February's orders.</p>

<p><strong>Reading on an Individual Node</strong></p>

<p>So all of that distributed system nonsense aside, what does each node do when performing a read? Recall that Cassandra has two levels of storage: Memtable and SSTable. The Memtable read is relatively painless -- we are operating in memory so the data is relatively small and iterating through the contents is fast as possible. To scan the SSTable, Cassandra uses a row-level column index and bloom filter to find the necessary blocks on disk, deserializes them and determines the actual data to return. There's a lot of disk IO here which ultimately makes the read latency higher than a similar DBMS. Cassandra does provide some row caching which solves much of that latency.</p>

<p>That's a whirlwind tour of Cassandra's read path. Take a look at the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/StorageConfiguration">StorageConfiguration</a> wiki page for much more content on this subject. Next up, I'll discuss some of the various &quot;tricks&quot; Cassandra uses to solve the myriad of edge cases inherent in distributed systems.</p>
