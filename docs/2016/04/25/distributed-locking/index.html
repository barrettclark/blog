<p>It can happen: sometimes you need to severely curtail access to a
resource.  Maybe you use a 3rd party API where you can only make one call at a
time.  To handle this extreme case, you need an extreme tool: a
distributed lock.</p>

<p>Distributed locks are dangerous: hold the lock for too long and your
system throughput plummets. They can easy become a major chokepoint for
your app's performance and scalability.</p>

<p>Recently a blog post talked about using Redis for
distributed locking with Sidekiq.  I tried the code and <strong>it didn't even
work</strong>. It did however give me the idea to test <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting">Sidekiq Enterprise's Rate Limiting
API</a>, which provides a flexible &quot;concurrent&quot; limiter,
against other rubygems which provide a similar lock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: I'm not talking about <a href="http://redis.io/topics/distlock">Redlock</a> and other algorithms that
provide fault-tolerant locking via distributed consensus.  Those
algorithms are slower and <strong>much</strong> harder to get correct; I would never trust
myself to write one (or anyone else that's not a Computer Science Ph.D).
In this post, I'm talking about using a single Redis instance to
coordinate many worker processes distributed across many machines.
This is sufficiently safe and robust for most businesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-setup">The Setup</h3>

<p>I tested four different distributed lock gems, including sidekiq-ent.
With any of them we can create a distributed lock which
ensures our system executes a block of code exclusively, even with dozens
of processes.  One thing to understand: <strong>sidekiq-ent's Rate Limiting API does
not need to run within a Sidekiq process</strong> - it can be used in any Ruby
process: puma, unicorn, passenger, sidekiq, etc.</p>

<p>All locking libraries provide similar semantics. You define:</p>

<ul>
<li>how long should the code wait for the lock before giving up?</li>
<li>how long before the lock times out?</li>
</ul>

<p>The lock has to have a timeout as that's the only way to recover from a
process crash while holding a lock.  Libraries &quot;wait&quot; in two different
ways: redis-semaphore and sidekiq-ent block, efficiently waiting to be
notified when they can take the lock, the other two gems poll regularly,
forcing an unfortunate tradeoff: polling more often means slamming Redis
with unnecessary work.</p>

<h3 id="the-test">The Test</h3>

<p>I created a benchmark exercising all four APIs.
The code executes 100 &quot;jobs&quot; using 25 threads.  Each job sleeps for 0.1
sec while holding the lock, meaning that a perfect run will take 10.0
sec.  <a href="https://gist.github.com/mperham/e0248bfb727ebf02ffd6b09172a85301">Gist of the actual benchmark code here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>sidekiq-ent
  0.110000   0.100000   0.210000 ( 10.433794)
redis-semaphore
  0.150000   0.150000   0.300000 ( 10.487963)
pmckee11-redis-lock
  0.460000   0.550000   1.010000 ( 10.718958)
ruby_redis_lock
  0.280000   0.250000   0.530000 ( 11.655952)
</code></pre>

<p>The third column shows you the number of seconds actually running on the
CPU; sidekiq-ent's limiter used 0.21 seconds of CPU time, the
others varied from 0.3 to 1.0 seconds.</p>

<p>The theoretical perfect runtime is 10 sec, 100 jobs * 0.1 sec sleep
so sidekiq-ent adds about 4% overhead.  The latter two gems added notably more overhead.
Note in the gist, I had to modify <code>pmckee11-redis-lock</code> to disable exponential
backoff, otherwise it would die with a timeout after several minutes.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the other three libraries give you no insight into actual lock usage while
sidekiq-ent's concurrent limiter offers real-time metrics so you can
understand how the lock is performing -- it can answer questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>how heavily is this lock contended?</li>
<li>is the lock ever timing out?</li>
<li>how often is the lock granted immediately vs forcing your code to wait?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting#concurrent-metrics">metric definitions in the wiki</a>.  Here's the UI:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mperham/sidekiq/master/examples/ent-concurrent.png" alt="Limiter Web UI" /></p>

<h3 id="what-have-we-learned">What have we learned?</h3>

<p>The other libraries give you the basics of a distributed lock but two
are lacking in performance and all are missing the metrics necessary to
debug problems.  Some good things about Sidekiq Enterprise's concurrent limiter:</p>

<ul>
<li>it provides the highest performance distributed lock for Redis</li>
<li>it blocks, it does not poll or sleep, so it won't slam Redis with superfluous requests or burn CPU</li>
<li>it can limit access to N callers, not just 1</li>
<li>it provides much better visibility with real-time metrics about limiter usage</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using Sidekiq today, the Enterprise upgrade will drop right in.
