      <h1>Tough Lessons in Software</h1>
      <small class="post-meta">Aug 7, 2008</small>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I was reading through some interview questions the other day and one of them was &quot;What was the toughest lesson you've learned in your job?&quot;</p>

<p>The answer came immediately: <em>the hardest problems in your job are human problems and cannot be solved with software.</em> As a software engineer facing a problem, I immediately consider if and how I might solve this problem using the chest of tools I know and understand: languages, parsers, data structures and algorithms.  However there are a class of problems which simply cannot be solved by throwing code at it.  Project management is one of those thorny issues which is ever-present in every company in the world.  Predicting when a product will be delivered, estimating task length, resource allocation, all of these have a theoretical basis in operations research but only when building something physical.  Software is knowledge work and knowledge work is mental: it is very difficult to create a manifest of parts, a design blueprint, or a predictable development schedule when building software.</p>

<p>I wonder if part of this problem doesn't have roots in our own evolution.  We are sensory-based creatures.  What we see, hear, touch, we appreciate, understand and can build.  Software is all in the head though.  It's a very difficult to build and usually takes months or years to build a decent sized system.  I think our brains can handle a T1 of sensory input but when comes to pure cognititive thought, even the brightest of us is stuck with an old modem.  We can't build a system in our head at once; we need to piece it together like an old hobo's jacket over months.</p>

<p>Even the best software project management processes rely on developers to write down and estimate time for all the tasks required to build a system.  This is project management state of the art: force each developer to plan what they are going to build.  We try to use that old modem to gloss over the upcoming work and get a feel for its timespan based on a brief mental judgment of the work involved.  It's never a perfect estimate, but with our brain's limited bandwidth for cognition, it's the best we've currently got.</p>
