      <h1>The Sidekiq Experiment, Part I</h1>
      <small class="post-meta">Aug 26, 2012</small>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>It's been about 6 months since I released the first version of <a href="http://mperham.github.com/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, my take on a high-performance background processing library for Ruby which is an order of magnitude more efficient than Resque and DelayedJob.</p>

<p>In some ways, Sidekiq has been a huge success: I've never owned an OSS project that has ramped up this quickly in terms of watchers, users, pull requests, etc. I'm still blown away that a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/366-sidekiq">Railscast</a> was created for Sidekiq!</p>

<p>But another part of the Sidekiq project is not technological at all but rather an experiment to answer another question: how can I build a library that is simple for others to use but also financially responsible for myself as a husband and father? I've spent hundreds of hours building Sidekiq and managing the project, how can I justify time away from my family in order to build and support the best tool out there for free?</p>

<p>Sidekiq's initial release was LGPL (actually GPL but that was my mistake and quickly fixed) and offered a (easy?) way for people to donate $50 in exchange for a more business-friendly license. In the last 6 months, I've sold about 15 licenses for about $700. Assuming I've spent 200 hours on Sidekiq, that's $3.50/hr or half of minimum wage. <strong>It's safe to say I do this because I love building software, not for the massive payday.</strong> I'm calling altruism and licensing a failure and an end to this part of the experiment.</p>

<p>What's next? Allow your workers to purchase in-app trinkets, a la Zynga? Sell out to IBM and create WebSphere SQ? Nope, but I have some ideas which I think everyone will be happy with. They're still early stages so I won't give any details but people who have bought a commercial license will be taken care of.</p>
