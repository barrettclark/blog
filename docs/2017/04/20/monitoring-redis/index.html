<p>Redis is widely by the Ruby community but, like any complex piece of
infrastructure, isn't well understood by many of its users.  I wanted to
write a blog post that would answer the question: <strong>How can I check on
the health of my Redis server?</strong>  Here's a few things you can do to
better understand your Redis server.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ask-for-info">Ask for Info</h2>

<p>The <code>info</code> command is the easiest way to get an overall view of Redis:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>(output trimmed a bit)</p>

<p>There's a few very important pieces to note in the output:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>config_file</code> shows where Redis is getting its static configuration.
If you need to tweak a setting, this is where to go.</li>
<li><code>connected_clients</code> shows how many network client connections are
currently connected.  It's normal for this to be in the hundreds or
even thousands for a very busy server.</li>
<li><code>used_memory_*</code> is important to see how much RAM is used by Redis.</li>
</ol>

<p>Memory is the most important thing to note here.  Your entire dataset
size <strong>must</strong> fit into machine RAM.  If it does not, the resulting swapping will lead
to terrible performance and massive latency spikes.</p>

<p><code>redis-cli --stat</code> will give you the most important details in a real-time view
you can watch or scrape:</p>

<pre><code>$ redis-cli --stat
------- data ------ --------------------- load -------------------- - child -
keys       mem      clients blocked requests            connections
31         1009.00K 1       0       681483 (+0)         576
31         1009.00K 1       0       681484 (+1)         576
31         1009.00K 1       0       681485 (+1)         576
</code></pre>

<p><code>redis-cli</code> is a very powerful tool with lots of nice features within
it.  It's worth running <code>--help</code> and playing with the various options
and modes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="look-out-for-latency">Look out for Latency</h2>

<p>Latency is the time difference between request and response, e.g. the client sends a
command and gets a result back in 10ms.  We want this round trip to be as fast as
possible.
Really bad latency can trigger &quot;Operation timed out&quot; exceptions in your application.
There are two general latency sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Network - the network between the client and Redis can be congested.</li>
<li>Internal - Redis itself might have commands or internal operations
which add significant latency.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="network">Network</h3>

<p>You can see the current network latency easily:</p>

<pre><code>$ redis-cli --latency
min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.29 (632 samples)
</code></pre>

<p>This shows a minimum of 0ms and max of 1ms, averaging 290Âµs, latency to
my localhost server.  Ideal conditions.</p>

<p>You can also easily watch latency history, here with a default window of 15 sec:</p>

<pre><code>$ redis-cli --latency-history
min: 0, max: 7, avg: 0.24 (1321 samples) -- 15.00 seconds range
min: 0, max: 256, avg: 0.55 (1280 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range
min: 0, max: 3062, avg: 3.86 (1051 samples) -- 15.98 seconds range
min: 0, max: 490, avg: 0.69 (1255 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the first window looks pretty good, the second window had a
spike of 256ms, and the third had a spike of 3062ms (ouch!).</p>

<p>I triggered these spikes by running <code>redis-cli debug sleep 0.5</code>.  Not
recommended in production.</p>

<h3 id="internal">Internal</h3>

<p>Redis also has a latency event and monitoring subsystem to track
commands execution latency and operations (like forking) which might
block command processing. Use the <a href="https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor">LATENCY</a>
commands to monitor and collect these events.  Some commands can be naturally
slow, see SLOWLOG below.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="watch-for-slow-commands">Watch for Slow Commands</h2>

<p>Because it is single-threaded, it's vitally important that all commands
to Redis process quickly or one slow command can block everyone else for
a significant amount of time.  Redis includes a configurable <a href="https://redis.io/commands/slowlog">SLOWLOG</a>
command to watch for these bad apples.</p>

<p>My Redis is configured by Homebrew to log any commands that take longer than 10ms, a
sensible default.  Run this on your instance and see if you find anything suspicious:</p>

<pre><code>$ redis-cli slowlog get 10
1) 1) (integer) 3
   2) (integer) 1492461257
   3) (integer) 11825
   4)  1) &quot;LPUSH&quot;
       2) &quot;queue:default&quot;
       3) &quot;{\&quot;queue\&quot;:\&quot;default\&quot;,\&quot;jid\&quot;:\&quot;df55c4e27c48e63f0d5212b4\&quot;,\&quot;class\&quot;:\&quot;LoadWorker\&quot;,\&quot;args\&quot;:[0],\&quot;created_at\&quot;:1492461257.208411,\&quot;enqueued_at\&quot;... (33 more bytes)&quot;
       4) &quot;{\&quot;queue\&quot;:\&quot;default\&quot;,\&quot;jid\&quot;:\&quot;4989e31cea7ecf78e93b7f9f\&quot;,\&quot;class\&quot;:\&quot;LoadWorker\&quot;,\&quot;args\&quot;:[1],\&quot;created_at\&quot;:1492461257.2084169,\&quot;enqueued_at... (34 more bytes)&quot;
      [snip]
      32) &quot;... (9971 more arguments)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>There are four parts to each entry: 3 is a unique identifier, 1492461257 is the timestamp
when it happened and 11825 is the number of microseconds for execution, 11.825ms.
The last part is the command with arguments.</p>

<p>I happen to know that entry is an LPUSH to the <code>default</code> queue of 10,000 jobs.  It's
a testcase for Sidekiq::Client's <code>push_bulk</code> API.  Since we're
enqueueing 10,000 jobs at once, it's not surprising that might take almost 12ms.</p>

<p><strong>It is safe to run SLOWLOG in production and highly encouraged.</strong>  In
fact, I would play with <code>slowlog-log-slower-than</code> values until you find
a setting that catches unexpectedly slow things but does not contain a
lot of &quot;normal&quot; commands from your application.
If you find the slowlog is constantly full, <strong>redesign your system so it
doesn't run those slow commands</strong>.
  For instance, if you want to enqueue
10,000 jobs, perhaps you could call <code>push_bulk</code> 10 times with 1000 jobs
each, so each invocation only takes 1/10th as long.
If a piece of OSS is running a slow comamnd,
open an issue so the maintainer knows about the problem.  I'm not too
proud to admit it's
<a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/3332">happened</a>
several times with Sidekiq; I fix them as fast as I can!</p>

<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>

<p>When I was managing technical operations, my team was
responsible for monitoring our infrastructure.  We would do things like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a cron job to dump the slowlog to a daily email if it is not empty.
Treat any entries as issues to be investigated and fixed.</li>
<li>Set up a dashboard for the Redis server.  Have dedicated
graphs for <code>connected_clients</code>, <code>instantaneous_ops_per_sec</code>, and <code>used_memory_rss</code>.
Treat big changes in these graphs as incidents to be investigated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Part of owning your infrastructure is monitoring its health proactively;
understanding these tools and having quick access to this data will be
invaluable when debugging failures and outages.</p>
